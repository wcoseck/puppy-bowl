Possible Issues The Program May Encounter!

Possible issues: 
1. Validation of Input. 

Empty Fields: Make sure that players that have blank names or breed fields cannot be added. Prior to pushing to the roster, add validation. There should also be a validation of images/URLs to make sure the image URL is inputted correctly.

Managing Invalid Inputs with Error Handling: Consider giving the user an error notice if there is a problem with the inputs. Also avoid duplicates of the same player, check to see if that same breed and name has already been inputted.

Confirmation on Remove: To avoid inadvertent removals, think about including a confirmation dialog box prior to removing a player.

2. Performance 

Images might take a long time to load or might not show the image properly, so perhaps opt to have a loading screen that allows the user to know their image will eventually load. 

If the user adds too many players the program might crass, so either improve the performance or set a limit to how many players there can be.
